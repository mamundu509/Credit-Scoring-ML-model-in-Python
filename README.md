# Credit-Scoring-ML-model-in-Python
Project Overview:

This credit risk scoring project has been undertaken on the data made public by 
Home Credit (2018), a company in the Czech Republic primarily concerned with providing credit to individuals who do not have a proper credit history and essentially aims to develop methods to predict customers most likely to default on their loan application so that their applications can be identified and rejected in time to minimize any financial strain that the company may suffer due to future bad debts

For these purposes Home Credit organized a data competition on a major data science competitions website called Kaggle (2018) from where the relevant data has been retrieved. The data provided was both internally and externally sourced i.e. internally collected data from Home Credit as well as relevant external sources to determine credit worthiness of customers on obtaining a loan.
